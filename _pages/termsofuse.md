#Terms of Use

##ShootSheet

ShootSheet is enabled via an auto-renewing subscription.

Certain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method.

Subscriptions will automatically renew until cancelled in the Manage Subscriptions section of your account settings. If you decide to unsubscribe from a Paid Subscription before we start charging your payment method, cancel the subscription at least twenty-four (24) hours before the free trial ends.

The duration and price of each subscription is displayed on the purchase screen, and updated at the time of purchase.

You will be notified if the price of a Paid Subscription increases and, if required, your consent will be required to continue. You will be charged no more than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the start of the latest Paid Subscription period.
