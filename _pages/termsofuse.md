# Terms of Use

## 1.0 ShootSheet
ShootSheet is enabled via an auto-renewable subscription with access to all features.

## 2.0 Subscriptions
The duration and price of each subscription is displayed on the purchase screen, and updated at the time of purchase.

You will be notified if the price of a Paid Subscription increases and, if required, your consent will be required to continue. You will be charged no more than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the start of the latest Paid Subscription period.

## 2.1 Subscription periods
You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (such as monthly or yearly), depending on the type of Subscription plan you select when purchasing the Subscription.
Certain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method.

If you start a free trial to a Paid Subscription and cancel before it ends, you cannot reactivate the free trial.

## 2.2 Cancellations
Subscriptions will automatically renew until cancelled in the Manage Subscriptions section of your account settings. If you decide to unsubscribe from a Paid Subscription before we start charging your payment method, cancel the subscription at least twenty-four (24) hours before the free trial ends.
